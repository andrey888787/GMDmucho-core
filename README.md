---

## 🚀 Quick start

MuchoCore is designed so you do not have to assemble PHP, MariaDB and Caddy manually.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IZKGMD/GMDmucho-core.git
cd GMDmucho-core
sudo ./install
```

The installer configures the database, PHP runtime, Caddy, Cloud Save secret, administrator account and the selected Geometry Dash compatibility profile.

After installation, verify:

```text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/health
```

Expected:

```text
1
```

Then open:

```text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/admin/
```

For the full VPS workflow, see **[docs/SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md)**.



### 🧭 VPS Control Center

After installation, MuchoCore provides an interactive terminal control center:

~~~bash
sudo mucho
~~~

It works over SSH from Windows PowerShell or directly from a Linux shell. The menu covers server status, configuration, updates, backups, logs and diagnostics.

Configuration changes include:

- GDPS domain;
- database password rotation;
- administrator password;
- Geometry Dash compatibility profile;
- YouTube import;
- music moderation;
- automatic updates.

Database password rotation updates the live MariaDB account and the Docker secret together. Passwords are not stored in the public environment file.

The installer itself can also be launched without cloning the repository first:

~~~bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IZKGMD/GMDmucho-core/main/install.sh | sudo bash
~~~

From Windows PowerShell:

~~~powershell
ssh -t root@YOUR-VPS-IP "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IZKGMD/GMDmucho-core/main/install.sh | bash"
~~~

### Custom plugins

MuchoCore supports a persistent custom plugin layer under:

~~~text
custom/plugins/
~~~

Plugins can add server-specific routes, lifecycle listeners and optional database-backed functionality without modifying the MuchoCore core source. The updater leaves this directory untouched, so customizations survive stable core updates.

See **[docs/CUSTOM_PLUGINS.md](docs/CUSTOM_PLUGINS.md)** for the plugin format, permissions and examples. The Admin Panel also includes **Custom Plugins** for read-only diagnostics and compatibility status.

Core updates are automatic **only after a published stable GitHub Release** exists. The Admin Panel detects the release, while the VPS updater deploys the exact release tag. `update.sh` remains available as the manual update/test path.

### Deployment flow

## 🎯 Geometry Dash compatibility

MuchoCore keeps **one server core** and selects version-specific behavior at the protocol boundary.

Supported runtime generations:

| Generation | Runtime profile | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GD 1.0** | `1` | Dedicated legacy identity compatibility layer |
| **GD 1.1** | `11` | Legacy endpoint-family compatibility |
| **GD 1.5** | `15` | Legacy protocol compatibility; real build 13 smoke-tested |
| **GD 1.6** | Legacy 1.x | Legacy protocol compatibility; real build 16 verified |
| **GD 1.9** | `19` | Legacy protocol and response handling |
| **GD 2.0** | `20` | 2.x protocol compatibility |
| **GD 2.1** | `21` | Version-aware modern protocol handling |
| **GD 2.2** | `22` | Modern protocol path with GJP2-aware authentication |
| **Custom** | e.g. `10,19,22` | Accept any selected combination |
| **All supported** | `all` | All supported generations |

The installer presents the supported 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 deployment profiles. The same server core handles all generations through the compatibility boundary. See **[docs/VERSIONS.md](docs/VERSIONS.md)** for the exact profile behavior.

### Verification scope

Real-client verification status:

| Client | Status |
| --- | --- |
| GD 1.0 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.1 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.2 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.3 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.4 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.5 build 13 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.6 build 16 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.7 build 17 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.8 build 20 | ✅ Verified |
| GD 1.9 | ✅ Verified |

The release validation is deliberately conservative:

- **GD 1.5 build 13** has passed a real-client smoke test covering level search, level upload, level update handling, comments, and the legacy UDID-based `updateGJUserScore` path.
- **GD 1.6 build 16** has passed a real-client end-to-end smoke test with the patched MuchoCore client.
- **GD 1.8 build 20** has passed a real-client smoke test on the shared early legacy 1.x compatibility path.
- **GD 1.9** has passed real-client verification.
- **GD 2.2** has a committed real-client contract fixture used by the release gate.
- **GD 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1** have dedicated protocol/regression coverage in the repository.
- Additional real-client release gates activate automatically when matching real-client fixtures are committed.

This means the README does not treat a synthetic contract as equivalent to a captured real-client trace.

See **[docs/CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/CLIENT_COMPATIBILITY.md)** and **[docs/PROTOCOL_MATRIX.md](docs/PROTOCOL_MATRIX.md)** for more detail.

## ⭐ Admin Rating Studio

MuchoCore includes a dedicated **Rating Studio** in the Admin Panel:

```text
/admin/?page=rating
```

It is designed for moderator/admin workflows instead of command-line rating.

### Rating workflow

```text
Find level
   ↓
Review pending request / current state
   ↓
Choose stars
   ↓
Choose one difficulty profile
   ↓
Choose feature tier
   ↓
Publish
   ↓
Creator Points + audit log updated
```

Available star values:

```text
0 → 10 stars
```

Available difficulty profiles:

```text
Unrated
Auto
Easy
Normal
Hard
Harder
Insane
Easy Demon
Medium Demon
Hard Demon
Insane Demon
Extreme Demon
```

Available feature tiers:

```text
None
Featured
Epic
Legendary
Mythic
```

The save operation canonicalizes the selected difficulty profile into the legacy Geometry Dash fields, clears the pending star request and recalculates creator points inside a transaction.

---

## 🔐 Admin authentication and security

The Admin Panel includes multiple security layers.

### Google Authenticator / TOTP

Administrators can enable Google Authenticator from the administrator settings.

The setup flow includes:

- a locally rendered QR code;
- manual setup secret fallback;
- server-side TOTP verification;
- a 10-minute pending setup expiry;
- enable/disable audit events.

The QR renderer is bundled with the project, so the secret is not sent to an external QR generation service.

### Administrator accounts

Each administrator uses a separate account. The first administrator created during installation is the `owner` account.

When the owner creates another administrator, they do not set the new administrator's password. MuchoCore creates a one-time password setup link instead:

    Owner
      ↓
    Administrators → Add administrator
      ↓
    Username + Role
      ↓
    One-time setup link
      ↓
    New administrator creates their own password
      ↓
    Normal Admin Panel sign-in

The setup link:

- is generated from a cryptographically random token;
- is stored only as a SHA-256 hash;
- expires after 24 hours;
- becomes unusable immediately after the password is created;
- is shown to the owner once so it can be delivered to the new administrator.

The initial built-in administrator roles are:

    owner
    admin
    moderator
    viewer

The `owner` account is the bootstrap-level administrator and has access to administrator management.

### Passkeys / WebAuthn

Administrators can register a native passkey for passwordless Admin Panel sign-in.

The browser/OS handles the credential picker and user verification (for example a device PIN, Windows Hello, Touch ID or Face ID). MuchoCore never receives or stores the private key. Login uses a discoverable credential flow, so the administrator does not need to type a username before the passkey is selected.

The registration flow requires a resident/discoverable credential and user verification. Challenges are short-lived and single-use, credentials are bound to the configured relying-party domain, and the authenticator signature counter is tracked. When TOTP is enabled on the administrator account, the passkey completes the primary credential step and the existing TOTP/recovery-code second factor remains required.

### MuchoProtect

MuchoProtect sits before the request router:

```text
Request
  ↓
MuchoProtect
  ↓
Identity + IP + Endpoint
  ↓
Rate / Burst Analysis
  ↓
ALLOW / BLOCK
  ↓
Geometry Dash-compatible response
```

Protection includes:

| Protection | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 🚦 Endpoint limits | Different limits for authentication, uploads, comments, messages, scores, ratings and other sensitive actions |
| 💥 Burst protection | Detects short high-frequency request spikes |
| 👤 Account isolation | Avoids treating a public account ID as a sufficient identity signal |
| 🌐 IP controls | Contains request floods while using privacy-aware audit metadata |
| 📋 Security audit | Records blocked-event metadata without exposing raw IPs in audit events |
| 🎮 Protocol-safe blocking | Uses Geometry Dash failure semantics such as `-1` instead of requiring HTTP errors |

---

## 🧰 Client patching

MuchoCore includes both local and web-based client patching workflows.

### Windows desktop patcher

Use:

```text
tools/client/client-patch.bat
```

The patcher:

1. checks the executable;
2. detects known Geometry Dash server URL formats;
3. performs compatible replacement;
4. writes a separate output executable;
5. never overwrites the original client.

Typical output:

```text
GeometryDash-MuchoCore.exe
```

Python is not required for the one-click batch workflow.

### Web Client Patcher

The Admin Panel includes:

```text
/admin/?page=clientpatcher
```

The web patcher supports Windows EXE uploads and performs the patch in a streaming/chunked PHP workflow.

It is designed for environments where you do not have shell access to a native patching binary.

### Android APK Patcher

The same Admin Panel tooling includes an Android APK patcher.

It can:

- upload the APK in small chunks;
- patch supported server URL layouts;
- process common native Geometry Dash libraries;
- remove invalid old signature metadata before rebuilding;
- produce a new APK archive.

The generated APK is **unsigned**. Sign it with your own Android signing key before installation or distribution.

### Client paths

Patched distributable builds can be kept under:

```text
patched/apk/
patched/exe/
```

Do not place signing keys, credentials or temporary files there.

See **[docs/CLIENT_SETUP.md](docs/CLIENT_SETUP.md)** for the complete client workflow.

---

## ☁️ Cloud save

MuchoCore includes Cloud Save support with protected server-side key handling.

Keep your Cloud Save secret outside the repository:

```text
.secrets/cloudsave_key
```

The deployment tooling preserves the configured secret across updates and container rebuilds.

Before major maintenance, create a database backup:

```bash
sudo /opt/mucho-core/bin/mucho-db-backup.sh
```

---

## 🔄 Updating an existing installation

For an installed server:

```bash
sudo /opt/mucho-core/update.sh
```

The updater:

- protects local tracked changes instead of silently overwriting them;
- resolves the latest published stable GitHub Release;
- fetches the exact release tag and never deploys directly from `main`;
- rebuilds Docker services;
- installs production PHP dependencies;
- runs database migrations;
- synchronizes administrator credentials;
- preserves the selected Geometry Dash compatibility profile;
- preserves Cloudflare Tunnel mode when configured.

After the update, verify:

```text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/health
```

and:

```bash
cd /opt/mucho-core
sudo docker compose ps
```

---

## 🧪 Validation

Every push and pull request runs GitHub Actions validation.

Current validation includes:

| Area | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| PHP | Syntax, application contracts and source checks |
| Protocol | Version matrix, legacy wire behavior and modern protocol guards |
| Security | MuchoProtect, authentication, TOTP and passkey contracts |
| Client tools | Windows patcher, Android patcher and Python self-tests |
| Routing | Caddy, Apache/shared-hosting compatibility and liveness routes |
| Docker | Compose validation and deployment configuration checks |
| Release | Version gate plus real-client 2.2 contract verification |

Run the main local test suite with:

```bash
composer test
```

Or the smoke/regression helpers:

```bash
composer smoke
composer regression
```

---

## 🔒 Production security basics

Never commit or publish:

```text
.env
.secrets/
storage/
config/cloudsave.key
```

Keep these outside version control:

- database passwords;
- Cloud Save secrets;
- administrator bootstrap credentials;
- Android signing keys;
- temporary client uploads;
- patched binaries containing private test data.

Before large changes, back up the database and verify that your Cloud Save secret is preserved.
