# MuchoCore VPS Setup

This guide is for a Linux VPS with root access or sudo.

## Requirements

- Linux VPS;
- root or sudo access;
- a domain pointing to the VPS;
- inbound ports 80 and 443 for normal HTTPS mode.

You do not need to install PHP, MariaDB or Caddy manually.

## 1. Point your domain to the VPS

Create a DNS record:

~~~text
gdps.example.com → YOUR-VPS-IP
~~~

Replace the example domain with your own.

## 2. One-command installation

You can run the installer directly from a Windows PowerShell SSH session or from the VPS shell. You do not need to clone the repository first.

From the VPS:

~~~bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IZKGMD/GMDmucho-core/main/install.sh | sudo bash
~~~

From Windows PowerShell:

~~~powershell
ssh -t root@YOUR-VPS-IP "curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IZKGMD/GMDmucho-core/main/install.sh | bash"
~~~

The installer opens an interactive setup wizard. Configure the domain, database name/user, Geometry Dash compatibility, YouTube import, music moderation and automatic updates, then continue. PHP, MariaDB, Caddy and Docker are installed/configured automatically.

The installer opens a version-selection menu:

~~~text
1) All supported versions (GD 1.9 - 2.2)
2) GD 1.9 only
3) GD 2.0 only
4) GD 2.1 only
5) GD 2.2 only
6) Custom profile
~~~

The selected compatibility profile is stored in `.env` and enforced by the runtime without duplicating the server core.

For unattended deployment, set `MUCHO_GD_VERSIONS` first:

~~~bash
export MUCHO_GD_VERSIONS=19,22
sudo -E bash install.sh
~~~

The installer prepares:

- Docker and Docker Compose;
- MariaDB;
- PHP 8.3;
- Caddy with HTTPS;
- the MuchoCore database;
- cloud save keys;
- the administrator account;
- the selected Geometry Dash compatibility profile;
- the interactive MuchoCore Control Center.

After installation, run:

~~~bash
sudo mucho
~~~

The Control Center provides an interactive terminal menu for server status, configuration, updates, backups, logs and diagnostics. Configuration changes are written through the deployment layer instead of requiring manual environment-file editing.

## 3. Verify the server

Open:

~~~text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/health
~~~

Expected response:

~~~text
1
~~~

Then open:

~~~text
https://YOUR-DOMAIN/admin/
~~~

The default administrator username is:

~~~text
admin
~~~

The password is created during installation.

## 4. Connect Geometry Dash

After `/health` works, follow `CLIENT_SETUP.md` for the client patching/connection flow.

## Updating

Use:

~~~bash
sudo /opt/mucho-core/update.sh
~~~

Or use:

~~~bash
sudo mucho
~~~

and choose **Update MuchoCore**.

Updates preserve the selected compatibility profile and Cloudflare Tunnel deployment mode.

### Release-based automatic updates

MuchoCore checks GitHub Releases on the VPS. A new **published stable release** triggers the automatic updater. Ordinary commits on `main`, drafts and prereleases are ignored.

The updater then runs the normal `update.sh` deployment path, which fetches the exact release tag and never deploys directly from `main`.

For manual deployment/testing, the same path remains available:

~~~bash
sudo /opt/mucho-core/update.sh
~~~

## Logs

~~~bash
cd /opt/mucho-core
sudo docker compose logs --tail=100
~~~

For live logs:

~~~bash
sudo docker compose logs -f
~~~

## Configuration and credentials

Use the Control Center instead of editing configuration files by hand:

~~~bash
sudo mucho
~~~

From its configuration menu you can change the GDPS domain, database password, administrator password, GD compatibility profile, YouTube import, music moderation and automatic updates.

Database password rotation updates the MariaDB account and the Docker secret together, then recreates the application container. The password is never written into the environment file.

## Backups

Before major changes, create a database backup:

~~~bash
sudo /opt/mucho-core/bin/mucho-db-backup.sh
~~~

The backup utility is portable across MuchoCore installation locations and performs the dump inside the MariaDB container.

Keep the Cloud Save secret safe:

~~~text
/opt/mucho-core/.secrets/cloudsave_key
~~~

It is mounted into the app as a Docker secret and is required to preserve
existing cloud save data across container rebuilds and updates.

## Removal

`uninstall.sh` removes the installation and its Docker database volume.

It requires an explicit `DELETE` confirmation.

## Advanced VPS setups

NAT/CGNAT VPS deployments and Cloudflare Tunnel are documented in `ADVANCED.md`.
